purposes# romans top 20 crypto recomendations 
Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

this is my cryptos recommendation website, which displays my favourite out of the top 20 cryptos. the website is split into 8 different page areas, giving an overview of the projects and a/3 scores 


## UX
My intention in the design was to make it straightforward to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design. The off wight and carbon fibre colour scheme were chosen to create a sleek and modern feel, along with the busy city at the top.


## Site/ demo
